# hello-world.-
First attempt - girls can code too right.

I've studied Economics at uni and was introduced to coding in R. Data analsis is alright but I've really enjoyed using Rmarkdown
to make things look beautiful. So now I'm pretty set on teaching myself how to be a front end web developer and hopefully 
branching out to aspects of back-end as and when I start to need it.
